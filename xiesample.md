## How I Use Markdown : My Tools and Steps

I use Markdown to write my [Expriments](https://www.github.com/saurabhterna), it's simple and productive.

I use [*Sublime Text 2*](http://www.sublimetext.com/) for text editing. It's powerful and easy to use.

My steps is very simple: use [*Markdown Preview Plugin*](https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview) to preview my blog. Then past the converted html code to WordPress. Done!

## Sample Code for Basic Markdown Syntax

This piece of sample code is written in Markdown, it includes basic styles and syntax of Markdown that I normally use to write my [blog](https://stevenyue.com)

It's simple and straightforward, i believe you can learn it within 5 minutes. Hope you can write a very nice blog :D


### 1. Heading or Title

Use `#` for header 1, `##` for header 2, `###` for header 3 and so on..

Under the header you can type your paragraph, it will have style `<p>` around


### 2. Links

1. Use `[Text](http link)` syntax, to insert link or anchor for the text like this: [Steven Yue's Blog](https://stevenyue.com)

2. Use `<http link>` syntax, gives you this: <https://stevenyue.com>


### 3. Add Bold, Italic to Emphasis Words

Use asterisks around text or words to emphasis them.

* Syntax like `*text*`, gives you *Italic* style of emphasis.

* Syntax like `**text**`, gives you **Bold** style of emphasis.


### 4. Blockquote

Just give some indent, use `tab` or `spaces` before paragraph, it will gives you nice quote with padding around

	Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

Also use ``text`` around some words inside of the whole paragraph.


### 5. List

- **Unordered list use hyphens `-` or `*` before the text**.

	Note: you can use combinations with list and emphasis, to make the display better.

- **Ordered list use numbers like `1.`, `2.`,... instead of `-`**

	If you put blank lines between items, youâ€™ll get `<p>` tags for the list item text. **Note: Don't forget to put indent before items**.


### 6. Code Highlight

Want highlighting for different programming language? Oh, that's complicate. For different platform, it's better to use they have their own way to do that.

For example, in wordpress, use can use `[sourcecode language="ruby"]` and `[/sourcecode]` around your code.
